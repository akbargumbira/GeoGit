<h1>GeoGit Quickstart<a class="headerlink" href="#geogit-quickstart" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>GeoGit is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) for geospatial data.</p>
<p>This document is a short introduction to the main ideas and elements of GeoGit. It describes how to set up and use GeoGit to version spatial data, introducing the following operations</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Importing unversioned spatial data into GeoGit</li>
<li>Making changes and storing snapshots or &#8220;commits&#8221;</li>
<li>Maintaining independent lines of modifications (&#8220;branches&#8221;)</li>
<li>Integrating changes from separate branches (&#8220;merge&#8221;)</li>
<li>Flagging and resolving conflicting edits.</li>
<li>Synchronizing data across a network (&#8220;push&#8221; and &#8220;pull&#8221;)</li>
<li>Mark specific versions of the data as approved or endorsed for use (&#8220;tag&#8221;)</li>
<li>Exporting data from GeoGit to common spatial formats such as Shapefile.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>Download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geogit/files/geogit-0.1.0/geogit-cli-app-0.1.0.zip/download">Version 0.1.0</a> from SourceForge. 
Full documentation is available for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/geogit/files/geogit-0.1.0/geogit_user_manual-0.1.tgz/download">download</a> and <a href="docs/index.html">online</a>.</p>

<p>To install unzip the <em>geogit-cli-app-0.1.0.zip</em> to an applications directory, and then add the unzipped <code>geogit/bin/</code> folder to your <strong>PATH</strong>.</p>
<p>-To test that GeoGit is ready to be used, open a console and type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">geogit</span> <span class="pre">help</span></tt>. You should see a list of available commands like the one shown below.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>usage: geogit &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]

The most commonly used geogit commands are:
--help          Print this help message, or provide a command name to get help for
add             Add features to the staging area
apply           Apply a patch to the current working tree
branch          List, create, or delete branches
cat             Provide content of an element in the repository
checkout        Checkout a branch or paths to the working tree
cherry-pick     Apply the changes introduced by existing commits
clean           Deletes untracked features from working tree
clone           Clone a repository into a new directory
commit          Record staged changes to the repository
config          Get and set repository or global options
conflicts       Shows existing conflicts
diff            Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
[...]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<h2>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>GeoGit needs some information about you, since it will use it when you create a new snapshot, to identify its author. Before we start working with geospatial data in GeoGit, you have to provide GeoGit with an user name and email, using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config</span></tt> command as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit config --global user.name "myname"
$geogit config --gloabl user.email "myemail@address.com"</pre>
</div>
<p>Replace the above data with your preferred name and email.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initialization">
<h2>Initialization<a class="headerlink" href="#initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unless you are getting your data from another GeoGit repository (which we will see how to do later in this quickstart), the first thing you have to do is to create your own repository. Create the folder that will contain the repository, move into it, and initialize the GeoGit repository typing</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit init</pre>
</div>
<p>Now your GeoGit repository is ready to hold your geospatial data and manage different versions of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-data">
<h2>Importing data<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To version a dataset, it has to be imported into the repository. Data in different formats can be imported into GeoGit.</p>
<p>Download the data in this zip file. It contains several folders, each of them with a snapshot of the dataset. We will use them to create our geogit repository, simulating the edition and creation of all the versions it contains.</p>
<p>We will start by importing the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot1/parks.shp</span></tt> shapefile, using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit shp import snapshot1/parks.shp
Importing from shapefile snapshot1\parks.shp
Importing parks            (1/1)... 100%
snapshot1\parks.shp imported successfully.</pre>
</div>
<p>The command above assumes you have unzipped the data file in the folder where you have created your GeoGit repo (don&#8217;t worry, it will not collide with the GeoGit repo itself, since that is all stored in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.geogit</span></tt> folder that the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></tt> command has created). If you have unzipped the data somewhere else, adjust the above path accordingly.</p>
<p>The data from the shapefile is now in the so-called <em>working-tree</em>. This means it is not versioned yet, but it is already in a format that GeoGit can understand, so it can be aware of the data and the changes you might introduce.</p>
<p>Run the following command to see that your data is actually in the working tree.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit ls-tree -r
parks/parks.2
parks/parks.3
parks/parks.1</pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, features from the shapefile are added to the working tree under a tree named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parks</span></tt>. The name is taken from the filename of the shapefile. A tree in a GeoGit repository can be seen as the equivalent of a folder in a filesystem</p>
<p>Running the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></tt> command will give you information about the data you have that is not already versioned.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit status
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "geogit add &lt;path/to/fid&gt;..." to update what will be committed
#   (use "geogit checkout -- &lt;path/to/fid&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory
#
#      added  parks/parks.2
#      added  parks/parks.3
#      added  parks/parks.1
# 3 total.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-data">
<h2>Adding data<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To tell GeoGit that you want to version the data in the working tree, you have to <em>add</em> it. To do it, run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit add
Counting unstaged features...3
Staging changes...
100%
3 features staged for commit
0 features not staged for commit</pre>
</div>
<p>Now your data is ready to be used to create a new snapshot (a <em>commit</em> in the GeoGit terminology).</p>
<p>If you now run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></tt>, command, you will see a different output, since your data has been added and it is now versioned.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "geogit reset HEAD &lt;path/to/fid&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#      added  parks/parks.2
#      added  parks/parks.3
#      added  parks/parks.1
# 3 total.
#</pre>
</div>
<p>When your data is added, it is copied onto the so-called <em>staging area</em>, which is the last area before it actually gets written to the repository database to create a new version.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="committing">
<h2>Committing<a class="headerlink" href="#committing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Commiting means creating a new version with the data currently in the staging area. You have imported your data and then added it, so now the staging area contains exactly the same data as your shapefile. By committing it, you will crate a new snapshot containing that data.</p>
<p>Type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit commit -m "first version"
100%
[592006f6b541557a203279be7b4a127fb9dbb2d9] first version
Committed, counting objects...3 features added, 0 changed, 0 deleted.</pre>
</div>
<p>The text between quotes after the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></tt> option is the commit message, which identifies and describes the snapshot that you create.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-new-version">
<h2>Adding a new version<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-new-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can add a new version, by importing new data, adding it and then commiting it. GeoGit does not incorporate tools to edit your data, which has to be done externally. GeoGit only takes care of versioning it.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot2/parks.shp</span></tt> file provided with the example data has the same data as the first file we imported, but with an extra feature.</p>
<p>If you run the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></tt> command after importing (and before adding), you will see it reports 1 added element. GeoGit can recognise the changes that have been done and identify the differences, and will not report modifications in the feature that haven&#8217;t been changed.</p>

<h2>Creating a branch<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-branch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data editing can be done on the main history line of the repository, but also on additional ones, so the main line can be kept clean and safe while you perform those edits. This also allows you to create &#8216;what if&#8217; scenarios without altering the data in your repository, which might be being used by other. Once your edits are finished and you think it&#8217;s worth adding them to the main history, you can merge them, as we will soon see.</p>
<p>To create a new branch named <em>myedits</em>, run the following command.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>::</dt>
<dd>$geogit branch myedits -c
Created branch refs/heads/myedits</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-c</span></tt> option tells GeoGit to switch your repository to that branch. Everything you do now will be added to this new history line, not the main one, as it was the case before.</p>
<p>Use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot3/parks.shp</span></tt> to create a new snapshot (once again, import it, add it and then commit it). It contains the same data of the last version, but with a new extra feature.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">log</span></tt> command will now show you a history like the one shown below:</p>

<h2>Merging changes from a different branch<a class="headerlink" href="#merging-changes-from-a-different-branch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can merge changes from a different branch into your current branch. Our repository has now two branches: the one we have created (<em>myedits</em>) and the main history one. The main history branch is always named <em>master</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s move the changes we have just added from the <em>myedits</em> branch into the <em>master</em> branch.</p>
<p>First move to the branch where you want to move changes to, in this case <em>master</em>. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checkout</span></tt> command, followed by the name of the branch, will make that branch the current active one.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'</pre>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">log</span></tt> command will now show the following history (we are producing a less verbose version of the history, by adding the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--oneline</span></tt> option):</p>

</div>
<p>The last commit is missing since it was added to the <em>myedits</em> branch. The <em>master</em> branch remains unchanged.</p>
<p>To merge the work done in the <em>myedits</em> branch into the current <em>master</em> branch, enter the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit merge myedits

<div class="section" id="handling-merge-conflicts">
<h2>Handling merge conflicts<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-merge-conflicts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the above case, the work done on the branch could be added without problems, but it is not always like that.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the following: create a new branch named &#8220;fix&#8221;, and create a commit based in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot4/parks.data</span></tt> shapefile. This new shapefile corrects a geometry, and it updates the corresponding area field to reflect that change. Use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checkout</span></tt> command to go back to <em>master</em>, and there create a new commit with the data in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot5/parks.data</span></tt>. This is the same data as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot3/parks.data</span></tt>, but changes the units in the <em>area</em> field.</p>
<p>What we have now is a conflict case, since the original version (the one corresponding to our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">snapshot3/parks.data</span></tt> file), has been changed differently in two branches, <em>master</em> and <em>fix</em>, as both have altered the <em>area</em> field.</p>
<p>If you now try to merge, GeoGit cannot automatically resolve that merge, since you have made changes in both branches, and they are incompatible (you can&#8217;t have the two new attribute values, but just one). The output of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">merge</span></tt> command will be like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit merge fix
100%
CONFLICT: Merge conflict in parks/parks.5
Automatic merge failed. Fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</div>
<p>You can see that there is a conflict by running the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></tt> command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "geogit reset HEAD &lt;path/to/fid&gt;..." to unstage)

#      modified  parks/parks.4
#      modified  parks/parks.1
# 4 total.
#
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "geogit add/rm &lt;path/to/fid&gt;..." as appropriate to mark resolution
#
#      unmerged  parks/parks.5
# 1 total.</pre>
</div>
<p>An unmerged path represents a conflicted element</p>
<p>You can get more details about the conflict by running the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conflicts</span></tt> command</p>
<dl class="docutils">

</dd>
</dl>
<p>The output indicates that the value in the <em>area</em> attribute of the <em>parks.5</em> feature is causing the conflict.</p>
<p>The conflict has to be solved manually, and you have to merge both versions yourself, or just select one of them to be used, discarding the other.</p>
<p>[NOTE: once we have a UI, we should change this to show a manual merge using the UI]</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we want to use the changed feature in the branch, not the one in <em>master</em>. Run the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit checkout --theirs</pre>
</div>
<p>That puts the branch version in the working tree, overwriting the previous one. Add it and that will remove the conflict.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit add</pre>
</div>
<p>And now commit it. There is no need to add a commit message, since that is created automatically when you are in a merge operation</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit commit</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tagging-a-version">
<h2>Tagging a version<a class="headerlink" href="#tagging-a-version" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can add a tag to a version, to easily identify it with something more descriptive than the ID associated to each commit.</p>
<p>To do so, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tag</span></tt> command like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit tag "First official version"</pre>
</div>
<p>Now you can refer to the current version with that name.</p>

<h2>Exporting from a GeoGit repository<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-from-a-geogit-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Data can be exported from a GeoGit repository into several formats, ready to be used by external applications</p>
<p>To export a given tree to a shapefile, use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shp</span> <span class="pre">export</span></tt> command.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit shp export parks parks.shp</pre>
</div>
<p>That will create a file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parks.shp</span></tt> with the content of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">parks</span></tt> tree.</p>
<p>Past versions can be exported by prefixing the tree name with a commit ID and a colon, like in the following example.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit shp export HEAD~1:parks parks.shp</pre>
</div>
<p>HEAD~1 refers to the previous commit, not of the first version we created, so this will export the example tree as it was in that first version.</p>

<div class="section" id="synchronizing-geogit-repositories">
<h2>Synchronizing GeoGit repositories<a class="headerlink" href="#synchronizing-geogit-repositories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A GeoGit repository can interact with other GeoGit repositories (known as <em>remotes</em>) that version the same data, getting changes from them or adding its own changes to them.</p>
<p>Also, an existing repository can be cloned, so you do not start with an empty one, as in the case of using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></tt> command.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s clone the repository we have been working on until now. Create a new empty folder in your filesystem, move into it and run the following command (replace the path with the current path were you had your GeoGit repository)</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit clone /path/to/repo</pre>
</div>
<p>Now you can start working on this new repository as usual, and you changes will be put on top of the changes that already exist in there, which were cloned from the original repository.</p>
<p>You can bring changes from the so-called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">origin</span></tt> repository, by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pull</span></tt> command</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$geogit pull origin</pre>
