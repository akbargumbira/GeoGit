{"name":"GeoGit","tagline":"Geospatial Distributed Version Control System","body":"Welcome to the GeoGit project, exploring the use of distributed management of spatial\r\ndata. GeoGit draws inspiration from Git, but adapts its core concepts to handle versioning\r\nof geospatial data. Users are able to import raw geospatial data (currently from Shapefiles, \r\nPostGIS or SpatiaLite) in to a repository where every change to the data is tracked. These\r\nchanges can be viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched in to sandboxed\r\nareas, merged back in, and pushed to remote repositories.\r\n\r\nFor background reading see these two papers on the spatial distributed versioning [Concept](http://opengeo.org/publications/distributedversioning/) and \r\n[Implementation] (http://opengeo.org/publications/distributedversioningimplement/).\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n=======\r\n\r\nProject Lead: [Gabriel Roldan] (http://github.com/groldan)\r\n\r\nLicense: Currently LGPL 2.1, soon changing to BSD New. \r\n\r\nStatus: A 0.1 release is coming soon, with a full commandline \r\ninterface to import data and work with repositories. A web API and user interface is slated for 0.2.\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n-----\r\n\r\nGeoGit is built using Maven\r\n\r\n```\r\n  cd src/parent\r\n  mvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnline tests, require a geogit endpoint, are available using::\r\n\r\n    mvn -Ponline\r\n\r\nCobertura is configured for a test coverage report::\r\n\r\n    mvn cobertura:cobertura\r\n    open target/site/cobertura/index.html\r\n    \r\nAny additional build profiles are documented in the root pom.xml .\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease carefully apply the code formatting options in the buld/eclipse/formatter.xml file. These are the standard\r\nJava formatting options with 100 character line length for both code and comments, and 4 spaces for indentation.\r\nIt is also recommended to use the code templates from build/eclipse/codetemlates.xml.\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSee: [QuickStart] (https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/blob/master/doc/quickstart/quicsktart.rst) and \r\n[Manual] (https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/tree/master/doc/manual/source) (full doc builds coming soon).\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe project is hosted on github:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit\r\n\r\nParticipation is encouraged using the github *fork* and *pull request* workflow::\r\n\r\n* Include test case demonstrating functionality\r\n* Contributions are expected to pass all tests and not break the build\r\n* Include proper license headers on your contributed files\r\n\r\nIssues to help out on are at: https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/issues\r\n\r\nFor those who can't code help on documentation is always appreciated, all docs can be found at \r\nhttps://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/tree/master/doc/ and contributed to by editing in ReStructuredText \r\nand using standard GitHub workflows.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject resources:\r\n\r\n* [Full on-line project documentation] (https://sites.google.com/a/opengeo.org/geogit-project-guide/)\r\n* [GeoGit Discussion Group] (https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geogit/)\r\n* The build is [actively monitored using hudson] (http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/geogit/)\r\n* https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/issues","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
