{"name":"GeoGit","tagline":"Distributed Version Control for Geospatial Data","body":"Welcome to the GeoGit project, exploring the use of distributed management of spatial\r\ndata. GeoGit draws inspiration from [Git] (http://git-scm.com/), but adapts its core concepts to handle versioning\r\nof geospatial data. Users are able to import raw geospatial data (currently from Shapefiles, \r\nPostGIS or SpatiaLite) in to a repository where every change to the data is tracked. These\r\nchanges can be viewed in a history, reverted to older versions, branched in to sandboxed\r\nareas, merged back in, and pushed to remote repositories. GeoGit is written in Java, available\r\nunder the [BSD License](https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\nFor background reading see these two papers on the spatial distributed versioning [Concept](http://opengeo.org/publications/distributedversioning/) and \r\n[Implementation](http://opengeo.org/publications/distributedversioningimplement/).\r\n\r\nWe are firmly in 'alpha' mode, working to release early and often, so please join us. Testing, \r\ndocumentation, ideas and patches are all greatly appreciated. Don't hesitate to \r\n[get in touch] (https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geogit/) with any issues, feedback or encouragement.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\n[Version 0.1.0](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geogit/files/geogit-0.1.0/geogit-cli-app-0.1.0.zip/download) from SourceForge. \r\nDocumentation available for [download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/geogit/files/geogit-0.1.0/geogit_user_manual-0.1.tgz/download) and [online] (docs/index.html).\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nUnzip the *geogit-cli-app-0.1.0.zip* to an applications directory, and then add the unzipped `geogit/bin/` folder to your **PATH**.\r\n\r\nRunning\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSee the [QuickStart] (docs/quickstart.html) guide for an introduction to GeoGit. Additional \r\ninformation available at the full [Manual] (docs/index.html).\r\n\r\nParticipation\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe project is hosted on github:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit\r\n\r\nDiscussion takes place on our [geogit google group] (https://groups.google.com/a/opengeo.org/group/geogit/). \r\nPlease join and introduce yourself, we'd love to help, and to figure out ways for you to get involved.\r\n\r\nParticipation is encouraged using the github *fork* and *pull request* workflow:\r\n\r\n* Include test case demonstrating functionality\r\n* Contributions are expected to pass all tests and not break the build\r\n* Include proper license headers on your contributed files\r\n\r\nIssues to help out on are at our [issue tracker] (https://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/issues).\r\n\r\nFor those who can't code help on documentation is always appreciated, all docs can be found at \r\nhttps://github.com/opengeo/GeoGit/tree/master/doc/ and contributed to by editing in ReStructuredText \r\nand using standard GitHub workflows.\r\n\r\nOur build is [actively monitored using hudson] (http://hudson.opengeo.org/hudson/view/geogit/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
